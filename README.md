# Cross-Asset-Market-Regime-Monitor
MSc in Financial Markets and Investments Python Programming for Finance
Overview First ssssions : 
In this session, we built a prototype of a market dashboard using Python. The objective was to
fetch market data (equities, FX, indices), validate it, transform it into returns, and plot aligned
series.
Throughout, we emphasized:
• fetching data robustly with yfinance,
• saving intermediate results to CSV,
• validating data types and missing values,
• aligning multiple series by their common start,
• computing cumulative returns for comparability,
• producing quick visualizations with matplotlib.
